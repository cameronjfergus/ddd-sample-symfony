# DDD sample Application

Real world example built from legacy code over Symfony.

Represent my vision based on my own reading and tests. Feel free to discuss point to improve the code !

## V1.0
First step to moving from Big Full Relational models to separate Bounded Contexts with dedicated models.

Use Doctrine as ORM.

Keep the database cardinality by tricking doctrine with many mapping files for a same table. Currently better solution to deal with that.
